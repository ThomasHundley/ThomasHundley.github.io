##The PC Master Race  <img src = "Logo.png">
My Website is dedicated to the PC Master Race, the ultimate group of gamers.  We have grown tired of the console market, as they sell overpriced, underpreforimg technology that can play the terrible quility games.  Their lies have deep roots in the modern gaming community, and many believe that the Xbox1 and the PlayStation are the best platfroms to game on.  This is simply, *not true*.  PC Gaming offering everything *and more*, and that is the purpose of my website.
