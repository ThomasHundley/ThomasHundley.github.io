		<p>This graph is made using an SVG, and shows which countires consume the most coffee.  An SVG is a scaleable vector graphic that changes its size and resolution to match the windows size.  This keeps the image clear enough to see at any window size.  This SVG changes format three times as the windows gets smaller getting rid of extra graphics and keeps things uncluttered.  After the first size change the people on the botton are removed and the number are atacked vertically.  after the second size change bars are added and the large coffe cup graphic is downsized and another person is added.</p>
