    <h1>Buying a PC</h1>
    <p>So you want to buy a PC?  Well, you have made the right decision!  Buying a PC is easy, and there are many diffrent places and websites to buy them.  If you wish to visit an actual store, do not go to Bestbuy, or any other common retailer.  I reccomend visiting a nearby Mico Center, as they have the best deals on the best PC's for you.  If you wish to buy online, Ibuypower is a great site that my friends and I all trust. </p>
    <h3>Building a PC</h3>
    <p>Oh don't be scared!  Building a PC is much easier than you think, and there are many guides on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bUghCx9iso" target="_blank"> youtube</a> and <a href="http://www.pcworld.com/article/2987057/computers/how-to-build-a-pc-a-step-by-step-comprehensive-guide.html" target="_blank">online</a> for you to watch. Many say that building a PC is like legos, and this can't be more true.  All you need is a screwdriver and a knife.  No soldering required.  Also, building a PC cant be rewarding and fun, not to mention much cheaper than buying a PC.  However, somtimes there are exceptions, so be on the lookout for good deals!</p>
    <h3>Buying Parts</h3>
    <p>This is the most important part of building a PC, and is the most confusing.  There are thousands of parts, with millions of combinations, which can drive new PC builders away.  For a start, I reccomend <a href="https://pcpartpicker.com/" target="_blank">this</a> site for picking out PC parts.  Pc Part Picker has access to thousands of diffrent parts, and lets you choose what you want, while checking for compatability and prices.  Once you have completed a build, you can then buy and ship yoour parts to anywhere in the world through UPS FedEx, or the mail.  </p>
