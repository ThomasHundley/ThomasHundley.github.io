    <h1>Benefits</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>PC gaming as a whole is much cheaper than console gaming. Especially in the long run, it can be less than half of what a console will cost you. Hidden fees, price hikes, and royalties are abundant for gamers AND developers in the console industry</li>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <li>PC hardware offers better bang-for-buck & value than console hardware (same performance for less money, more performance for the same money, or much more performance for a bit more money)</li>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <li>PCs have the freedom to upgrade whenever YOU decide to, not when Sony or Microsoft decide to. If you just got a big paycheck and wanted to sell your R7 260 to a friend for $50 and buy an R9 380 for $150 tomorrow, you could do it.</li>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <li>PCs can play nearly every old PC and console game ever made, thanks to its tremendous legacy support, emulator availability, and GOG.</li>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <li>Gaming services and "social services" on the PC are completely free, even with online play (Steam, Galaxy, Desura, Mumble, etc)</li>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <li>Gaming services on the PC offer more functionality than what you pay for on a console</li>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <li>Using a modern budget GPU yields around 60 frames per second during gameplay with recent game releases. Consoles can barely reach 30FPS most of the time.</li>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <li>PCs are much more powerful than the PS4 or XBox One at the same (traditionally believe to be affordable!) price point</li>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <li>More exclusives than all the current-gen consoles combined</li>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <li>PC games have free modifications and enhancements available. Old games and new games alike have player-made content, graphical enhancements, and additions available for free.</li>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <li>Healthy independent developer scene</li>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <li>Higher resolutions than consoles (such as 1080p, 1440p, 1600p, 4k, and 8k!) if your display supports it and you have GPU power you're willing to spare. Consoles struggle, even at 720-900p!</li>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <li>Higher graphical details (lighting, textures, foliage, particles, shading, weather)</li>
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <li>You're probably going to own some sort of PC anyways, why not pay a bit more on top to make it a gaming machine? That alone makes it cheaper than a console.</li>
